# Scripts, mostly Shell and AWK

This is my collection of Unix scripts and related notes.

## How to Use

Feel free to use these scripts: download any you like,
copy useful sections, or use them for inspiration or
as a memory aid.

## Index

- [heil.awk](awk/heil.awk) - print he(ad and ta)il of stream

## Scripting

Refrain from using non-POSIX features. For shell scripting this
means that the shell is *not* bash and that not all tools have
all options. Consult the [POSIX standard][posix], available in
HTML form from [The Open Group][opengroup]. More info on POSIX
and the scripts can be found in [separate notes](doc/NOTES.md).
